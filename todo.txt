To-do:

- Finish self.logger.log_summary(total_living, self.total_dead, self.total_vaccinated, '', ) in simulation.py
  - Maybe include a self.simulation_end_reason = '' string and set it once that while loop _simulation_should_continue is finished.
  - have an interaction counter of those 100 interactions * each infected person? a counter?
  - Of those interactions, need to separate the vaccinated and deaths

Doing:
- logger.py output specs: https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/Herd-Immunity-Simulation#questions-and-answers-about-the-problem 

Done:
- include answers.txt
- create_population
- my simulation isn't updating things properly.
- update counters and total vaccinated as time steps are going along
- what should be in _simulation_should_continue() method? 
self.dead_population = [] list, loop and skip dead people later on. tip from George 







SCRATCH:

every sick person interacts with 100 other people in population. Only can infect uninfected, unvaccinated people. 
The chance of a sick person infecting a person that they interact with is the virus's reproductive rate. 
Example: if a virus has a reproductive rate of 15, then, on average, a sick person should infect 15 of the 100 people they interact with during that time step.

Rules:
An infected person cannot infect a vaccinated person. This still counts as an interaction.
An infected person cannot infect someone that is already infected. This still counts as an interaction.

At the end of a time step, an infected person will either die of the infection or get better. 
The chance they will die is the percentage chance stored in mortality_rate.

The simulation should output a logfile that contains a record of every interaction that occurred during the simulation. 
We will use this logfile to determine final statistics and answer questions about the simulation.

while dead, or same person, pick another random person. 

Should I keep track of random person chosen here, so they aren't selected randomly again?
